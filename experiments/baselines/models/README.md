This directory contains the code for the models used for baseline experiments

There are two versions of the same models -- 

1. Static - which takes a single image as the input. Meant for datasets such as spatialsense and VisualGenome
2. Dynamic - which takes a video as input and uses multiple frames from it. Meant for datasets like ViDVRD. 


the directory `encoder/` contains the model weights for word2vec encoder.
