To check how well the STUPD dataset generalizes on real world dataset, we will pretrain a CLIP architecture on STUPD, and perform zero shot performance on real world dataset. 


CLIP_for_STUPD contains code for setting up the STUPD dataloaders for pretraining CLIP architectures, as well as modifying the CLIP architecture to take frames of videos.
